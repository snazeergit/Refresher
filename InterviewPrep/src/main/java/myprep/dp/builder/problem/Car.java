/*
 * ðŸ“Œ What is Builder Design Pattern?

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. 
It allows you to build different representations of an object using the same building process.

Use it when:
	â€¢	You have a complex object with many optional parameters.
	â€¢	You want to make your object creation readable and maintainable.
 * 
 * 
 * If we have a scenario where we wanted to pass only few properties to create an object then we are forced to write 
 * overloaded constructors as below and we have no choice, it makes the code mode complex and messy to avoid this we 
 * go for builder design pattern where we have capability to pass the properties only required to construct an object.
 * Lets say I need an obj only with brand and model properties, may be i need another obj only with price, like wise.
 * This was discussed in myprep.dp.builder.solution1 package.
 * We can make specific properties mandatory for every obj that is discussed in myprep.dp.builder.solution2 package
